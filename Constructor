Syntax of constructor declaration : 

def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor
Types of constructors : 

default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesnâ€™t accept any arguments.
Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.
parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. 
The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.
Example of 

Default constructor : 

class GeekforGeeks:

	# default constructor
	def __init__(self):
		self.geek = "GeekforGeeks"

	# a method for printing data members
	def print_Geek(self):
		print(self.geek)


# creating object of the class
obj = GeekforGeeks()

# calling the instance method using the object obj
obj.print_Geek()


Example of the parameterized constructor : 

class Addition:
	first = 0
	second = 0
	answer = 0
	
	# parameterized constructor
	def __init__(self, f, s):
		self.first = f
		self.second = s
	
	def display(self):
		print("First number = " + str(self.first))
		print("Second number = " + str(self.second))
		print("Addition of two numbers = " + str(self.answer))

	def calculate(self):
		self.answer = self.first + self.second

# creating object of the class
# this will invoke parameterized constructor
obj = Addition(1000, 2000)

# perform Addition
obj.calculate()

# display result
obj.display()
